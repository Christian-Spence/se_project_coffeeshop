# My Very Own Coffee Shop â˜• (Spence's Coffee Shop)

https://christian-spence.github.io/se_project_coffeeshop/

This is a project of mine where I engineered a website for a coffee shop. 
The coffee shop has imported videos helping other people create recipes at home, 
a booking form so people can book a table to visit the store location in person, 
a menu showing the cost of my products, 
and information about the shop and social media links.

It was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plans on improving the project

- Increasing the menu size to add a bigger diversity of products.
- Adding more videos to the recipes page so that whoever visits the website can have more recipes to learn how to make at home.
